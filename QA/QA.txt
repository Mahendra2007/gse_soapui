Question from Offshore-

Adding some more queries:

1.	Can Tiers be associated with Perpetual offer
2.	What segment program will be displayed as Member pricing for Transient Users
3.	What is Room Allowance? How are the values configured(if it cannot be configured can we get the data for some property)


@Durgesh â€“ Need information for following queries:
1.       To what number of days is TierMaxDiscount considered i.e., if we configure TierMaxDiscount as 2,will we be able to apply Tier Program Rates for 2 days of each trip or is it only 2 days within certain date range(if so, on what range)
2.       If the Tier Program gives COMP will it be reduced from the CompMax Limit
3.       If DayBetweenTrip is configured to be 2 and DailyLimit to be 2, Will we able to make 2 reservations on the same date range with perpetual offer rates
4.       Will CompMax and RateMax apply on Party and Split reservations and its modification?
